# Gridworld City, a thriving metropolis with a booming technology industry, has recently experienced an influx of
# grid-loving software engineers. Unfortunately, the city's street parking system, which charges a fixed rate,
# is struggling to keep up with the increased demand. To address this, the city council has decided to modify the
# pricing scheme to better promote social welfare. In general, the city considers social welfare higher when more
# parking is being used, the exception being that the city prefers that at least one spot is left unoccupied (so that
# it is available in case someone really needs it). The city council has created a Markov decision process (MDP) to
# model the demand for parking with a reward function that reflects its preferences. Now the city has hired you — an
# expert in dynamic programming — to help determine an optimal policy.

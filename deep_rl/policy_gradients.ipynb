    "**def.** **Maximum likelihood estimation** is a method that determines values for the parameters of a probability distribution (model). The parameter values are found such that they maximise the likelihood that the process described by the model produced the data that were actually observed. For example, typical neural network training will usually try to maximise probabilities of specific output.\n",
